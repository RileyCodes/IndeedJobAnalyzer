# IndeedJobAnalyzer
 
a web crawler and report generator made for data-driven carrier planning.

this tool would answer your questions such as:

 how many jobs posted in my local area come with C# and WPF together?

 does job posted with Java always ask for Spring?

 when a job asked for c++, what are the most common framework or additional skills they are looking for?

 out of 100 jobs, how many of them mentioned a bachelor's degree?

 What's the most commonly asked certification?

with the power of IndeedJobAnalyzer, you can plan your carrier backed by statistics instead of guessing.
