## About The Project

* how many jobs posted in my local area come with C# and WPF together?

* does job posted with Java always ask for Spring?

* when a job asked for c++, what are the most common framework or additional skills they are looking for?

* out of 100 jobs, how many of them mentioned a bachelor's degree?

* What's the most commonly asked certification?
